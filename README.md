 Analyzing Spotify and YouTube Songs Using Python & MySQL
Project Description: 
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of analyzing a real-world database using SQL, extracting valuable insights from the dataset, pre-processing the data using Python for enhanced performance, and leveraging structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database.
The project is divided into two modules:

Module 1: 
Pre-processing the dataset Data pre-processing is a crucial step in data analytics as unprocessed data can lead to undesirable outcomes when used for further applications. This module focuses on various sub-tasks such as handling null values, deleting or transforming irrelevant values, converting data types, and removing duplicates.


Module 2: 
Analyzing data using SQL This module involves writing concise SQL queries to retrieve data based on specific problem statements. You will work with the pre-processed data from the previous module and perform data analysis using SQL. The goal is to generate queries that address given problem statements and derive insights from the data.
